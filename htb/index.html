        		<h2>Why HTB?</h2>
			<p>First of all, stop whatever you are doing and check out <a href="https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2019/03/29/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJNulls_Preparation_Guide_for_PWK_OSCP.html">TJ Null's list</a>.  The theme of this site is "learning through doing" and I beleive with all I am that the jounrey to OSCP is one that takes experience.  You can't read about how to enumerate and suddenly be good at it.  You need to have done it before.  You need to have seen what works and what doesn't.  What's your favorite password list and why?  Hashcat or John the Ripper?  Why is Burp the greatest?  These are great interview questions that you wouldn't be able to answer without experience.  I chose HTB to get that experience.<p>
			<p> Now that you've done that, here are some walkthroughs that I've written based on Tony's list.  These are purposely different than the typical walkthrough you'll find if you search for "htb machinename".  What I've enjoyed so much about this journey is learning how to approach a host like a pen tester / bad guy / purple teamer.  As a defender, you operate within a set of rules and can sometimes be blind to something right in front of you.  The pen tester / bad guy /purple team methodoloy is relatively simple:<br>-Enumerate<br>-Research<br>-Exploit
